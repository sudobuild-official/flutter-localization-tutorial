# Flutter Localization Tutorial

This project is a simple yet complete example of adding localization (multi-language support) to a Flutter application using the [easy_localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization) package.
It demonstrates how to configure and switch between different languages (English and French) while keeping the Flutter app lightweight and easy to understand.

## Overview

This tutorial project helps you learn:

- How to configure easy_localization in Flutter
